            <h2>The Sand Trap: Golf's Hardest Shot</h2>
            <p>The most dreaded shot in golf must be, without a doubt, the sand trap recovery shot. Golfer’s everywhere dread getting caught in the sand, sometimes you’ll hear phrases like “grab a towel!” or “beach day!” but have no misunderstanding, the sand trap is not a place of joy. If you ever find yourself in such a situation, this guide will serve as a tool to help you get out in just <b>One Shot</b>.
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose the right club.</strong><p>When entering a bunker, it is important to take a club with a high <i>loft</i>. Loft is the angle at which a club face lies relative to the ground. A high loft club means that it will launch the ball at a higher angle, allowing to go higher in the air. When in a sand trap, you need to be able to get the ball high enough to get out of the hole you're in. My recommendation is to take a "sand wedge" which is the club marked with an 'S' in your bag. If you have clubs marked with the degrees, aim for 56 degree or higher.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Take the right stance.</strong><p>Upon entering the bunker, assess the lie of your ball. Take note of the depth your ball is in the sand and the distance from your ball to the outside of the bunker. As you go to take your stance, make sure you keep your body open. Instead of aligning your feet normally, you want to stand angled from the ball, at almost a 45 degree angle.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Swing the right way.</strong><p>The most important part of hitting the perfect bunker shot is the, well, the shot itself. Unlike a normal golf shot where you want to sweep the ground, a bunker shot swing requires you to hit 1-2 inches <i>behind</i> the ball. Remember, after you swing, your follow-through in incredibly important. The follow-through will carry the ball into the air and out of the bunker.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>If you follow this guide, you will be hitting bunker shots like this in no time</strong></p>

            <h2>My experience with Venture for America</h2>
            <p>During the summer going into my senior year of college, I was fresh off my summer internship but didn't feel like I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated from school. I have always had an 'entreprenuerial drive' and knew that whatever I did for work, I wanted to learn how to start my own business while doing it. Out of the blue, a friend of mine reached out to me via Linkedin and asked me if we could chat. Little did I know, this conversation would change my career trajectory forever. We chatted on the phone about his status as an MSU Alumni, and what he was doing for work. He mentioned that he became a fellow in a program called <strong>Venture for America.</strong> He told me this program was designed to place recent college grads in start-up companies across 14 different cities in America. After hearing about his time as a fellow, I knew this program was exactly what I had been searching for. It turns out, funny enough, that he had actually reached out to me with the intent of referring me to the prorgam. I quickly began the 4 stage application process, applying just before the end of the first deadline. The 4 stages of the application process were:
            <ol>
                <li>Resume review</li>
                <li>Short essays</li>
                <li>One on one interview with a current fellow</li>
                <li>An all-day group interview</li>
            </ol>
        <p>I passed one stage after another until I got to the final round. During the all day interviews, we were challenged as a group to solve 3 different cases that simulate the fast-paced environment of working at a start-up. I thoroughly enjoyed these interviews and felt like I really got a chance to show my interviewers who I was. In the end, I got an offer and chose to accept! I start in July 2021, and I could not be more excited!
